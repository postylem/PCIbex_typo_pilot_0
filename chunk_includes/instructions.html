    <h4>Welcome!</h4>
    
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Your task in this experiment is to read sentences. These will be shown to you word by word.
    First, an asterisk (*) will appear.</p>
    <div class="primer">*</div>
    <p>Press <kbd>Space</kbd> when you are ready to start the first sentence. 
    First you will only see dashes indicating the length of the sentence:</p>
    
    <div class='lindent sentence'>___ ___ ______ ___ ____</div>

    <p>To see the first word of the sentence, please press <kbd>Space</kbd>:</p>

    <div class='lindent sentence'>The ___ ______ ___ ____</div>

    <p>As soon as you press <kbd>Space</kbd> again, the next word will appear and the previous word will disappear. Keep pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> to proceed through the sentence.</p>
    
    <div class='lindent sentence'>___ dog ______ ___ ____</div>
    <div class='lindent sentence'>___ ___ chased ___ ____</div>
    <div class='lindent sentence'>___ ___ ______ teh ____</div>
    <div class='lindent sentence'>___ ___ ______ ___ cat.</div>
    
    <p>Read the sentences at your own normal reading pace, so that you understand the content.
        <b>Note, some of the sentences may have words which are incorrectly spelled.</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>Press <kbd>Space</kbd> after you have read a sentence to see the next one.</p>

    <p>Sentences are followed by a comprehension question with two answer options. Please answer to this question by clicking on the most appropriate response.</p>

    <p>Once you have given an answer, you cannot revise it. Just continue with the next sentence. A comprehension question might look like this:</p>

    <div class='lindent'>
        <p>What animal chased the cat?<br>
        1. A cat <br>
        2. A dog
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>First, you will practice the task using 4 examples. Then the actual experiment will follow.</p>
